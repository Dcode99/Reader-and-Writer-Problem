Sample Code Provided By: Dr. Manivannan

To compile, type "make" or "make all".
It creates five executables "load" "print" "change" "query" and "clean"
Run load to load the shared memory with the file, create the semaphores, and create the read_count in memory.
Run print to print all of the student information in the shared memory.
Run query to query for a specific student in the shared memory.
Run change to edit, delete, or add a student's information to the shared memory.
Run clean to destroy the shared memory segments and semaphores. Do not run query, print, or change before loading again.
Clean will also save the shared memory segment with student information to "save.txt"

To delete all executables, type "make clear".

This code is written in C. The semaphore method used is based off of the readers and writed problem discussed in class lectures.
